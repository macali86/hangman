# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I have just completed the first 4 tasks of the Hangman project. The 1st task was to create a list of my favourite fruits and then printing them, the list was named word_list.

The 2nd task of this project was to create a small code that selected one of the list items randomly and printed it. I had to use the import random module and then created a random.choice method that passed word_list variable through it.

The 3rd task of this project was to use the input() function to get a single letter from the user under the variable name guess.

And finally the 4th task was to use if and else statements within the guess function to make either return the message "Good Guess" if the user inputted 1 letter or the message "Oops! That is not a valid input" if either no letters or more than 1 were inputted.

  Conclcusion: Overall these 4 tasks were a good refresher on the basics of Python and some of the earlier lessons and practicals that I have done during this course.
